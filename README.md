## Overview

Vitals transforms fitness tracking into a blockchain-powered accountability system that leverages financial incentives and competition to drive goal completion. Users commit to fitness challenges by staking funds, with rewards distributed to those who successfully complete their goals.

## Key Features

- **Automated Verification**: Seamless integration with Google Fit, Apple Health, and Fitbit for transparent progress tracking
- **Reward Distribution**: Complete your goals to reclaim your stake plus a share of funds from unsuccessful participants
- **Social Engagement**: Compete in public challenges or create private groups with friends
- **Real-time Leaderboards**: Track progress, earn badges, and stay motivated with gamified elements

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Solana for secure, transparent transactions
- **Mobile**: Native application for iOS and Android
